# CEML Design Goals

1. Expression templated, GPU and CPU locatable linear algebra + Deep learning library
2. Support for computing gradients
3. Load a model definition at compile time, to achieve minimum memory footprint and maximum performance.

# Objecives
1. No allocation during running of network
2. No polymorphism
3. CUDA support
